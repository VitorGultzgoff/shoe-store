# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/shoe-store-server/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/shoe-store-server/db/*.sqlite3
/shoe-store-server/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/shoe-store-server/log/*
/shoe-store-server/tmp/*
/shoe-store-server/**/**.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/shoe-store-server/tmp/pids/*
!/shoe-store-server/tmp/pids/
!/shoe-store-server/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/shoe-store-server/storage/*
!/shoe-store-server/storage/.keep
/shoe-store-server/tmp/storage/*
!/shoe-store-server/tmp/storage/
!/shoe-store-server/tmp/storage/.keep

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
